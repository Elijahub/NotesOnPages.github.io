**Effective Date:** February 8, 2026

**Last Updated:** February 8, 2026

## Overview

Nopes ("Extension") is a Chrome extension designed to help users add, manage, and organize sticky notes on web pages. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Storage

### Local Storage Only
- All notes created through Nopes are stored **locally on your device** using Chrome's `chrome.storage` API.
- We do **NOT** collect, transmit, or store your notes on remote servers.
- We do **NOT** track your browsing activity or collect analytics.
- We do **NOT** use cookies or third-party trackers.

### Permissions Explained

The extension requests the following permissions:

1. **`host_permissions: <all_urls>`** — Allows Nopes to inject notes on any webpage you visit. This is necessary to display and manage notes regardless of which site you're on. The extension does not transmit or analyze webpage content.

2. **`storage` permission** — Allows the extension to save and retrieve your notes using Chrome's secure local storage. Your data never leaves your device.

## Data Retention

- Your notes remain stored on your local device indefinitely, unless you manually delete them through the extension interface.
- Uninstalling the extension will not automatically remove stored notes (depending on your Chrome settings).

## Third-Party Services

Nopes does **NOT** use any third-party analytics, ad services, or data processors. All functionality is self-contained within the extension's code.

## Security

- All data is stored locally using Chrome's encrypted storage APIs.
- We recommend using a strong password on your user account to protect your device.

## User Rights

- You have full control over your notes: create, edit, delete, and organize them at any time.
- You can uninstall the extension at any time to stop using it.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as the extension evolves. Any material changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.
